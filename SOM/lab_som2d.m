% -- Purpose: Trains a 2D SOM, which consists of a grid of
%             (neuronCountH * neuronCountW) neurons.
%             
% -- <trainingData> data to train the SOM with
% -- <som> returns the neuron weights after training
% -- <grid> returns the location of the neurons in the grid
% -- <neuronCountW> number of neurons along width
% -- <neuronCountH> number of neurons along height
% -- <trainingSteps> number of training steps 
% -- <startLearningRate> initial learning rate
% -- <startRadius> initial radius used to specify the initial neighbourhood size

% TODO:
% The student will need to copy their code from lab_som() and
% update it so that it uses a 2D grid of neurons, rather than a 
% 1D line of neurons.
% 
% Your function will still return the a weight matrix 'som' with
% the same format as described in lab_som().
%
% However, it will additionally return a vector 'grid' that will
% state where each neuron is located in the 2D SOM grid. 
% 
% grid(n, :) contains the grid location of neuron 'n'
%
% For example, if grid = [[1,1];[1,2];[2,1];[2,2]] then:
% 
%   - som(1,:) are the weights for the neuron at position x=1,y=1 in the grid
%   - som(2,:) are the weights for the neuron at position x=2,y=1 in the grid
%   - som(3,:) are the weights for the neuron at position x=1,y=2 in the grid 
%   - som(4,:) are the weights for the neuron at position x=2,y=2 in the grid
%
% It is important to return the grid in the correct format so that
% lab_vis2d() can render the SOM correctly
